# Téléphone à crabes

### What is it ?
This is a simulation app for the third problem of the TFJM² 2017. It simulates the movement of crabes. 
For now, you can only simulate the movement of crabs on a single line. All crabs are aligned.

### Installation

The gui lays on pygame and [my own pygame GUI module](https://github.com/ddorn/GUI), so you must have both installed.
If you have troubles installing pygame, try [this](https://youtu.be/MdGoAnFP-mU).

### Commands 

 * `Right arrow` to reveal one more collision
 * `Left arrow` to hide one collision
 * `S` to save a screenshot
 * `Escape` to quit
